<!-- Lists in Html -->

<!-- In Html, you can create ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists to organize and
Present the information on your website. Here I show you how to create each type of list. -->

1. **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**

    <!-- Ordered lists are used when you want to present a list of items that have a
     specific order. Each item in the list is automatically numbered. You can create ordered lists
     in the following way. -->

    <ol>
        <li>Element 1</li>
        <li>Element 2</li>
        <li>Element 3</li>
    </ol>

    This will generate a numbered list like this:

    1. Element 1
    2. Element 2
    3. Element 3

     2. **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**

    <!-- Unordered lists are used when you want to present a list of items without an order
     specific. Each item in the list is presented with bullet points (points). You can create lists
     disordered as follows. -->

    <ul>
        <li>Element A</li>
        <li>Element B</li>
        <li>Element C</li>
    </ul>

    This will generate a bulleted list like this:

    - Element A
    - Element B
    - Element C

    3. **Definition Lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`)**

    <!-- Definition lists are used when you want to present a list of terms and their
     associated definitions. You can create definition lists as follows. -->

    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>
        <dd>Definition of term 1.</dd>
        <dt>Term 2</dt>
        <dd>Definition of term 2.</dd>
    </dl>

    This will generate a list of terms and definitions like this:

    Term 1
    - Definition of term 1.

    Term 2
    - Definition of term 2.

<!-- You can combine these lists and nest them as necessary to structure your information.
Web page. Additionally, you can use Css to customize the appearance of lists and their elements. -->

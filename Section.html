<!-- Section in Html -->

<!-- In HTML, the `<section>` tag is used to create a thematically related section of
content on a web page. Sections allow you to divide and organize the content of the page.
semantically and help search engines and assistive technologies better understand the
page structure. -->

Here is an example of how to use the `<section>` tag

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Example tag &lt;section&gt; in HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Main Title</h1>
        </header>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation bar -->
        </nav>
        <section>
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>Content of Section 1.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>Content of Section 2.</p>
        </section>
        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2023 My Company - All rights reserved.</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

    <!-- In this example, two sections (`<section>`) have been created that contain related content.
    Each section begins with a heading (`<h2>`) that describes its contents. The use of the label
    `<section>` helps structure the page and communicate that these two blocks of content are
    related to each other. -->

<!-- It is important to note that the `<section>` tag does not indicate any visual style by itself; HE
used mainly for semantic and structural purposes. You can apply styles to sections
using Css to control the design and visual appearance of your website. -->

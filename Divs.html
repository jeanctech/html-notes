<!-- Divs in Html -->

<!-- `<div>` elements in Html are div containers used for grouping and structuring
content on a web page. The `<div>` are block elements without any semantic meaning of their own,
meaning they have no specific purpose, unlike elements like `<p>` for paragraphs
or `<h1>` for headings. Instead, `<div>`s are used primarily for organization and
design, and Css is applied to them and often given identifiers or classes to style or manipulate
its content. -->

     <!-- Here is an example of how `<div>` elements are used in Html. -->

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>Example of &lt;div&gt;</title>
            <style>
                .container {
                    border: 2px solid #000;
                    padding: 20px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
                <h1>This is an example div</h1>
                <p>Divs are used to group content and apply styles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h1>Another example div</h1>
                <p>This is another div that is used to structure content.</p>
            </div>
        </body>
        </html>

        <!-- In this example, we have created two `<div>` elements with the class "container". This
        elements They are used to group content and apply a border and padding via Css. The `<div>`
        They are commonly used to create structure on a web page and organize sections of content,
        such as headers, sidebars, footers, among others. They are also useful for applying
        Custom styles and designs to sections of a web page. -->

<!-- In short, `<div>` elements are generic containers used to structure and
designing web pages, and are an essential part of the design and organization of content in
Html and Css. -->

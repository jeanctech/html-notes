<!-- Tables in Html -->

<!-- In Html, tables are created using the tags `<table>`, `<tr>` (row), `<th>` (header)
table) and `<td>` (data cell). Tables are used to organize data into rows and columns. Here
You have a basic example of how to create a table in Html. -->

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 3</td>
        <td>Fact 4</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- In this example -->

    - The `<table>` tag defines the table itself.
    - Each table row is created with the tag `<tr>`. You can have multiple rows in a table.
    - Table headers are created with the `<th>` tag. Headers usually have a highlighted background and bold text by default.
    - Data cells are created with the tag `<td>`. These are the cells that contain the actual data.

<!-- This code will generate a simple table with two rows and two columns -->

-------------------------
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
| Fact 1    | Fact 2    |
| Fact 3    | Fact 4    |
-------------------------

<!-- You can customize the layout of your tables using Css to change colors, borders, spacing and
other visual styles. You can also add attributes to tags to adjust the behavior
of the table, such as setting column widths or alignments. Tables are useful for displaying data
tabular, but you should also make sure they are accessible and adapt to responsive web designs
when necessary. -->

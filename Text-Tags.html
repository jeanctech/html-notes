<!-- In Html, there are several tags used to format and structure the text on a web page
Here are some of the most common tags for working with text. -->

     the most used tags to structure textual content on a web page. -->

     <p>This is an example paragraph.</p>

     <!-- 2. **Headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`)**: Header tags are used to
     give hierarchical structure to the text. `<h1>` is the main header, followed by `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and
     so on for minor headings. -->

    <h1>Main Header</h1>
    <h2>Secondary Heading</h2>

     <!-- 3. **Bold (`<strong>`) and italic (`<em>`) text**: The `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are
     used to emphasize text, rendering text bold and italic, respectively. -->

    <p>This is <strong>bold text</strong> and this is <em>italic text</em>.</p>

     <!-- 4. **Quotes (`<blockquote>`) and Short Quotes (`<q>`)**: These tags are used for quoting
     text. `<blockquote>` is used for longer quotes and `<q>` for shorter quotes. -->

    <blockquote>
        This is a long quote that can take up several lines.
    </blockquote>

     <!-- 5. **Ordered list (`<ol>`) and unordered list (`<ul>`) with list elements (`<li>`)**
     These tags are used to create lists of items, numbered (ordered) or unnumbered
     (disorderly). -->

        <li>Element 2</li>

     </ol>

     <!-- 6. **Line break (`<br>`) and topic separator (`<hr>`)**: `<br>` is used to create a
     line break within a paragraph, while `<hr>` is used to insert a horizontal line
     that divides the content. -->

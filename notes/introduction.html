<!-- HTML Introduction -->

<!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages
and web applications. It was initially developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 and has evolved over the years.
over the years. HTML is essential for the structure and content of most web pages
what you see on the internet. Here is an introduction to key HTML concepts. -->

<!-- 1. **Markup and Structure**: HTML is a markup language, which means that it is used to
        mark or structure the content of a web page. Use tags to define elements and give them
        meaning. The labels are surrounded by angles (`<` and `>`).

        2. **HTML Elements**: HTML elements are the basic components of a web page. Each element
        It starts with an opening tag, contains content, and ends with a closing tag. By
        For example, `<p>` defines a paragraph of text. -->

<p>This is an example paragraph.</p>

<!-- 3. **Nesting**: HTML elements can be nested within other elements. This allows
        create more complex structures. For example, a paragraph (`<p>`) can contain text and links
        (`<a>`).

        4. **Attributes**: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the
        element. For example, the `href` attribute is used on a link (`<a>`) to specify the URL of
        destination. -->

<a href="https://www.example.com">Example link</a>

<!-- 5. **Versions of HTML**: Over the years, there have been several versions of HTML. HTML5 is
        the latest and most widely used version, and provides more advanced features for
        creating modern web pages.

        6. **Basic Structure**: A typical HTML document has a basic structure that includes elements
        like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<HTML>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<body>`, etc. This sets the basis for
        the website and its content.

        7. **Styles and Behavior**: HTML is used to mark the structure and content, but not
        to control design or behavior. For this, cascading style sheets (CSS) are used.
        for design and JavaScript for interaction and functionality.

        8. **Accessibility**: It is important to create accessible web pages that can be used by everyone
        people, including those with disabilities. HTML provides semantic features and
        specific attributes to improve accessibility.

        9. **Browser Compatibility**: Although HTML5 is widely compatible with most
        modern browsers, it is important to consider compatibility with older versions and
        use features that are widely accepted. -->

<!-- HTML is the basis of most web pages and is a fundamental language for any
Web developer. As you continue to learn HTML, you can combine it with CSS for layout and
JavaScript for interactivity, thus creating complete and engaging web experiences. -->

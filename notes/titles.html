<!-- Titles in HTML -->

<!-- In HTML, you can use title tags to define headings on your web page. The
Headers help organize and prioritize the content of the page. HTML offers six levels of
headings, from `<h1>` (the most important) to `<h6>` (the least important). Here is an example
how these labels are used. -->

<h1>Level 1 Header (h1)</h1>
<h2>Level 2 Header (h2)</h2>
<h3>Level 3 Header (h3)</h3>
<h4>Level 4 Header (h4)</h4>
<h5>Level 5 Header (h5)</h5>
<h6>Level 6 Header (h6)</h6>

<!-- Each header level represents a hierarchy of importance, where `<h1>` is the most important
and `<h6>` is the least important. Headings are used to structure and format your
content. Search engines and assistive technologies use this hierarchical structure
to better understand the content of the page. -->

<!-- It is important to remember that headings also have a default presentation style
(font size and weight) that can be modified using CSS to fit the design of your website.
Furthermore, it is recommended to use headers in a consistent and semantic way, that is, use `<h1>`
for the main page title, `<h2>` for important sections, `<h3>` for subsections, and so on
successively. This improves the readability and accessibility of your website. -->

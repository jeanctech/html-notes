<!-- Section in HTML -->

<!-- In HTML, the `<section>` tag is used to create a thematically related section of
content on a web page. Sections allow you to divide and organize the content of the page.
semantically and help search engines and assistive technologies better understand the
page structure. -->

Here is an example of how to use the `<section>`

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Example tag &lt;section&gt; in HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <header>
        <h1>Main Title</h1>
      </header>
      <nav>
        <!-- Navigation bar -->
      </nav>
      <section>
        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>Content of Section 1.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Section 2</h2>
        <p>Content of Section 2.</p>
      </section>
      <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Company - All rights reserved.</p>
      </footer>
    </body>
  </html>

  <!-- In this example, two sections (`<section>`) have been created that contain related content.
    Each section begins with a heading (`<h2>`) that describes its contents. The use of the label
    `<section>` helps structure the page and communicate that these two blocks of content are
    related to each other. -->

  <!-- It is important to note that the `<section>` tag does not indicate any visual style by itself; HE
used mainly for semantic and structural purposes. You can apply styles to sections
using CSS to control the design and visual appearance of your website. -->

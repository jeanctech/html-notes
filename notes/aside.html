<!-- Aside in HTML -->

<!-- The `<aside>` HTML element is used to mark content that is related or secondary
with respect to the main content of a web page. You can use `<aside>` to include content
additional information that complements the main information on the page, such as sidebars, notes, advertising
, related links, widgets and more. Below I show you an example of how the element is used
`<aside>` in HTML. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example of &lt;aside&gt;</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Main Title</h1>
    </header>
    <aside>
      <h2>Sidebar</h2>
      <p>This is secondary content, such as related links or widgets.</p>
    </aside>
    <main>
      <h2>Main content</h2>
      <p>This is the main content of the web page.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>Footer</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, we have used `<aside>` to create a sidebar that contains content
secondary. This is just an example, and you can customize the content within `<aside>` based on the
needs of your website. -->

<!-- The `<aside>` element is especially useful for improving the semantic structure of the page and
facilitate the understanding of content by search engines and technologies
attendance. -->

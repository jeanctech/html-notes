<!-- Classes in HTML-->

<!-- In HTML, classes are used to add style or behavior information to elements
HTML. Classes allow you to select a group of elements and apply CSS rules or behavior to them
specific using JavaScript. To define a class in HTML and then apply it to an element,
follow these steps. -->

<!-- 1. **Define a class:** Defines a class in the `<style>` element or in an external CSS file.
    You can do it in the following way: -->

<style>
  .my class {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<!-- In this example, we have defined a class called "my-class" that changes the color of the text to blue
    and set the font size to 16 pixels. -->

<!-- 2. **Apply a class:** Apply the class you have defined to an HTML element using the
        `class` attribute. You can add the `class` attribute to any HTML element you want
        stylize or modify with class. -->

<p class="my-class">This paragraph has the class "my-class" applied.</p>

<!-- In this case, we have applied the class "my-class" to a paragraph, which will result in the change of
         Text color and font size according to the rules defined in the class. -->

<!-- You can apply the same class to multiple elements on your page, making consistency easier
         in the design and format of your website. Also, you can have multiple classes on a single element,
         separating them with spaces, for example: `class="my-class another-class"`. -->

<!-- Classes are a fundamental part of the styling and structure of a web page, and are
widely used in combination with CSS and sometimes JavaScript to add interaction to
The elements. -->

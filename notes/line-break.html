<!-- Line Break in HTML-->

<!-- In HTML, to create a line break or white space, you can use two elements
main ones: `<br>` and `<p>`. Each one is used in different contexts and has a slightly different behavior.
different. -->

1. **`<br />` (Break Line)**: The `<br />` tag is used to create a line break
within a paragraph or in any block element. Used to force a line break where
place. Here is an example.

<p>This is a first paragraph.</p>
<br />
<p>This is a second paragraph.</p>

<!-- In this example, a line break is created between the two paragraphs. -->

2. **`
<p>` (Paragraph)**: The `</p>
<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs in HTML. When it's used `</p>
<p>
  `, white space is created before and after the paragraph content, separating
  the content similarly to a line break. Here is an example.
</p>

<p>This is a first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a second paragraph.</p>

<!-- In this case, the two paragraphs are separated by white space, which acts as
   similar to a line break. -->

<!-- In general, it is recommended to use the `<p>` tag to always divide content into paragraphs
as possible, as this provides a clear semantic structure and facilitates the application of
CSS styles. The `<br>` tag is used less frequently and is often useful when you want to force a
line break within a block element, such as a paragraph. -->

<!-- Semantic HTML -->

<!-- Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML tags in a meaningful and
structured to represent information on a web page. By applying semantic HTML, you give each
element a clear semantic purpose, which makes the code more readable and understandable, both
for developers as well as for search engines and assistive technologies. -->

<!-- Here are some of the most common semantic tags in HTML5 that help structure and give
meaning to a web page. -->

<!-- 1. **`<header>`**: Represents the header of a section or the main header of the page.
     May include logos, titles, navigation bars and other elements related to the
     introduction of the content.

     2. **`<nav>`**: Used to define the main navigation or menu bars on a web page.

     3. **`<main>`**: Indicates the main content of the page. There must be a single `<main>` element
     on each page.

     4. **`<article>`**: Used to encapsulate self-contained and meaningful content, such as an article
     news, a blog post, or a forum post.

     5. **`<section>`**: Used to group thematically related content within a page. Is
     a versatile tag that can be used to subdivide content into logical sections.

     6. **`<aside>`**: Used to define related but non-essential content such as bars
     sides, advertisements or support elements.

     7. **`<figure>` and `<figcaption>`**: `<figure>` is used to wrap content that needs to be

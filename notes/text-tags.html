<!-- Text Tags in HTML -->

<!-- In HTML, there are several tags used to format and structure the text on a web page
Here are some of the most common tags for working with text. -->

<!-- 1. **Paragraphs (`<p>`)**: The `<p>` tag is used to create paragraphs of text. It is one of
     the most used tags to structure textual content on a web page. -->

<p>This is an example paragraph.</p>

<!-- 2. **Headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`)**: Header tags are used to
     give hierarchical structure to the text. `<h1>` is the main header, followed by `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and
     so on for minor headings. -->

<h1>Main Header</h1>
<h2>Secondary Heading</h2>

<!-- 3. **Bold (`<strong>`) and italic (`<em>`) text**: The `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are
     used to emphasize text, rendering text bold and italic, respectively. -->

<p>This is <strong>bold text</strong> and this is <em>italic text</em>.</p>

<!-- 4. **Quotes (`<blockquote>`) and Short Quotes (`<q>`)**: These tags are used for quoting
     text. `<blockquote>` is used for longer quotes and `<q>` for shorter quotes. -->

<blockquote>This is a long quote that can take up several lines.</blockquote>

<p>As someone famous said: <q>This is a short quote.</q></p>

<!-- 5. **Ordered list (`<ol>`) and unordered list (`<ul>`) with list elements (`<li>`)**
     These tags are used to create lists of items, numbered (ordered) or unnumbered
     (disorderly). -->

<ul>
  <li>Element 1</li>
  <li>Element 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Element 1</li>
  <li>Element 2</li>
</ol>

<!-- 6. **Line break (`<br>`) and topic separator (`<hr>`)**: `<br>` is used to create a
     line break within a paragraph, while `<hr>` is used to insert a horizontal line
     that divides the content. -->

<p>This is text.<br />This is a line break.</p>

<p>Text before the topic separator.</p>
<hr />
<p>Text after the topic separator.</p>

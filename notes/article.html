<!-- Article in HTML -->

<!-- In HTML, the `<article>` element is used to define a separate section or content
freelance on a website. This element is commonly used to encapsulate content that
It could live on its own and be reused in other parts of the site or on different websites.
Here is an example of how the `<article>` element is used in HTML -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example of &lt;Article&gt;</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <article>
      <h1>Article Title</h1>
      <p>
        This is an example of an HTML article. May contain significant content,
        such as news, blog posts or any independent content.
      </p>
      <p>You can also include images, links and other HTML elements.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h1>Other Article</h1>
      <p>
        This is another independent article on the same page. You can have
        multiple items in a web page.
      </p>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, we have created two `<article>` elements. Each of them encapsulates content
independent, such as titles, paragraphs and, in practice, could contain images, links and
other HTML elements. -->

<!-- It is important to note that the `<article>` element is semantic and helps search engines
and screen readers to understand the structure of the page and the importance of its
content. -->

<!-- Divs in HTML -->

<!-- `<div>` elements in HTML are div containers used for grouping and structuring
content on a web page. The `<div>` are block elements without any semantic meaning of their own,
meaning they have no specific purpose, unlike elements like `<p>` for paragraphs
or `<h1>` for headings. Instead, `<div>`s are used primarily for organization and
design, and CSS is applied to them and often given identifiers or classes to style or manipulate
its content. -->

<!-- Here is an example of how `<div>` elements are used in HTML. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example of &lt;div&gt;</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        border: 2px solid #000;
        padding: 20px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>This is an example div</h1>
      <p>Divs are used to group content and apply styles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Another example div</h1>
      <p>This is another div that is used to structure content.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, we have created two `<div>` elements with the class "container". This
        elements They are used to group content and apply a border and padding via CSS. The `<div>`
        They are commonly used to create structure on a web page and organize sections of content,
        such as headers, sidebars, footers, among others. They are also useful for applying
        Custom styles and designs to sections of a web page. -->

<!-- In short, `<div>` elements are generic containers used to structure and
designing web pages, and are an essential part of the design and organization of content in
HTML and CSS. -->

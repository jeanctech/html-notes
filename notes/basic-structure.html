<!-- Basic HTML Structure -->

<!-- The basic structure of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document consists of several elements
that define the structure and content of a web page. Here you have an HTML structure
typical. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

<!-- The key elements of this structure are described below -->

<!-- 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declares the version of HTML being used in the document.
     In this case, HTML is used, which is the latest version of HTML

     2. `<html>`: This element encompasses all the content of the page and serves as the root container.

     3. `<head>`: The `<head>` element contains information about the document, such as metadata, links to
     style sheets (CSS), links to scripts (JavaScript), and the page title.

     - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This line specifies the character encoding of the document,
     commonly UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.

     - `<title>`: The `<title>` element defines the title of the page that will appear in the page tab.
     browser.

     4. `<body>`: The `<body>` element contains the main content of the web page, such as text,
     images, links, forms, and other HTML elements. -->

<!-- Within `<body>`, you can add a variety of HTML elements to structure and style
your web page, such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`,
`<li>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`,
`<button>`), and more. -->

<!-- Here's an example of how you could fill the basic HTML structure with content. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a company committed to quality...</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>Copyright Â© 2023 My Website</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>

You can customize and expand the content according to the needs of your project. -->

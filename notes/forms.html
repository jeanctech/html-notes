<!-- Forms in HTML -->

<!-- HTML forms are a fundamental way to interact with users and collect data.
You can create forms to receive information, comments, registrations and more. Then you
I show how to create a basic HTML form. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Contact form</h1>
    <form action="process.php" method="POST">
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />

      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />

      <label for="message">Message:</label>
      <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" required></textarea>

      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, a simple contact form has been created with the following elements. -->

<!-- 1. `<form>`: Defines the form. The `action` attribute specifies the URL to which they will be sent
     the data when the user submits the form, and the `method` attribute specifies whether to use
     the Post or Get method to send the data. Usually, sensitive data, such as passwords,
     They are sent with the Post method. -->

<!-- 2. `<label>`: Labels that describe the form fields. The tag is associated with the
     field using the `for` attribute. -->

<!-- 3. `<input>`: Input elements, in this case, text fields for name and email
     electronic. The `type` attribute defines the type of the input field (in this case, "text" and "email").
     The `id` attribute is used to associate the label with the field, and the `name` attribute is used to
     identify the field when the form is submitted. -->

<!-- 4. `<textarea>`: Used to create a larger text field, in this case, for the
     message. The `rows` attribute specifies the number of rows in the field. -->

<!-- 5. `<input type="submit">`: This is a submit button that allows the user to submit the
     form. The `type` attribute is set to "submit" to indicate that it is a submit button. -->

<!-- 6. The `required` attribute on the input fields and the text field makes these fields
     are mandatory and cannot be sent empty. -->

<!-- When the user completes the form and clicks the submit button, the data is sent to the
server specified in the form's `action` attribute for processing. -->

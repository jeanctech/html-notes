<!-- Icons in HTML -->

<!-- To include icons in HTML, you can use icon fonts, images or even vector icons. TO
Next, I show you some of the most common ways to incorporate icons into your web pages. -->

<!-- 1. **Icon fonts** -->

<!-- **Font Awesome**: Font Awesome is one of the most popular icon fonts. You can add your
     icons on your website by linking to their source or using their icon kit.

      To link Font Awesome in your HTML, you must add the following code in the `<head>` section of your
     document -->

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/CSS/all.min.css"
/>

Then, you can use the icons in your content like this:

<i class="fas fa-home"></i>

<!-- **Material Icons**: Google Material Icons is another widely used icon source. Can
     link it as follows. -->

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
/>

Then, you can use the Material Icons icons in your HTML:

<i class="material-icons">home</i>

<!-- 2. **Icon images**:

    You can use icon images (for example, Png or Svg files) and add them to your web page using
    the `<img>` tag. Make sure the images are in the correct location on your server and
    Let the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag point to the image Url. -->

<img src="icon.png" alt="House icon" />

<!-- 3. **Vector icons**:

    Vector icons, such as those created with Svg (Scalable Vector Graphics), are scalable and can be
    can be incorporated directly into the HTML code. Here is an example of how to insert an Svg icon
    on your page.

    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
       <path d="M12 2c-5.523 0-10 4.477-10 10s4.477 10 10 10 10-4.477 10-10-4.477-10-10-10zm0 18c-4.418 0-8-3.582-8-8s3.582- 8 8-8 8 3,582 8 8-3,582 8-8 8zm-2-14v10l9-5z"/>
    </svg> -->

<!-- You can customize the size and color of the icons according to your needs, and it is often used
CSS to style them. The choice of icon technique will depend on your preferences and requirements
of design. -->

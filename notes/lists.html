<!-- Lists in HTML -->

<!-- In HTML, you can create ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists to organize and
Present the information on your website. Here I show you how to create each type of list. -->

1. **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**

  <!-- Ordered lists are used when you want to present a list of items that have a
     specific order. Each item in the list is automatically numbered. You can create ordered lists
     in the following way. -->

  <ol>
    <li>Element 1</li>
    <li>Element 2</li>
    <li>Element 3</li>
  </ol>

  This will generate a numbered list like this: 1. Element 1 2. Element 2 3.
  Element 3 2. **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**

    <!-- Unordered lists are used when you want to present a list of items without an order
     specific. Each item in the list is presented with bullet points (points). You can create lists
     disordered as follows. -->

    <ul>
      <li>Element A</li>
      <li>Element B</li>
      <li>Element C</li>
    </ul>

    This will generate a bulleted list like this: - Element A - Element B -
    Element C 3. **Definition Lists ('<dl>`, `<dt>`, `</dt>', '<dd>`)**

        <!-- Definition lists are used when you want to present a list of terms and their
     associated definitions. You can create definition lists as follows. -->

        <dl>
          <dt>Term 1</dt>
          <dd>Definition of term 1.</dd>
          <dt>Term 2</dt>
          <dd>Definition of term 2.</dd>
        </dl>

        This will generate a list of terms and definitions like this: Term 1 -
        Definition of term 1. Term 2 - Definition of term 2.

        <!-- You can combine these lists and nest them as necessary to structure your information.
         Web page. Additionally, you can use CSS to customize the appearance of lists and their elements.
        -->
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </ul>
</ol>

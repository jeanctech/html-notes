<!-- Common Errors in Html -->

<!-- In web development, it is common to make mistakes in Html, especially if you are new to
web programming. Here are some of the most common mistakes you should avoid. -->

     <!-- 1. **Lack of closing tags**: Each opening tag (`<tag>`) must have a tag
     corresponding closing tag (`</tag>`). Forgetting to close the labels is one of the most common
     mistakes common in Html. -->

    <!-- Incorrect Example -->

    <p>This is a paragraph without a closing tag.

        <!-- 2. **Poor nesting of tags**: Make sure tags are nested correctly
        For example, if you open an element within a paragraph, you must close it before closing the paragraph. -->

       <!-- Incorrect Example -->

       <p>This is a <strong>strong paragraph.</p></strong>

        <!-- 3. **Labels misspelled or with syntax errors**: Labels and attributes must be
        written correctly and without syntax errors. Errors like `<b>wrong text</i>` are
        common. -->

        <!-- 4. **Lack of attributes in tags**: Tags often need attributes to
        work properly. For example, the `src` attribute is essential for image tags. -->

        <!-- Incorrect Example.-->

       <img> <!-- The "src" attribute is missing -->

        <!-- 5. **Use obsolete elements**: Avoid using obsolete or deprecated HTML elements, such as
            `<center>`, `<font>`, `<strike>`, which are not supported in Html5. -->

        <!-- 6. **Do not use semantic tags**: HTML5 introduces semantic tags such as `<header>`,
        `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc. Failure to use these labels properly may affect the structure and
        the accessibility of the site. -->

        <!-- 7. **Do not provide "alt" attributes on images**: The "alt" attribute on image tags
        image is important for accessibility and description of the image. -->

       <!-- Incorrect Example -->

       <img src="image.jpg">

        <!-- 8. **Failure to take into account responsiveness**: Failure to ensure that the website is responsive to
        different screen sizes is a common mistake in web design. -->

        <!-- 9. **Do not validate Html code**: Do not validate your Html code with a validator, such as validator
        of W3C, can lead to subtle errors that affect the appearance and functioning of the site. -->

        <!-- 10. **Excessive use of inline styles**: It is preferable to separate HTML content from styles
        using style sheets (Css) instead of inline styles. -->

        <!-- 11. **Not optimizing images**: Not optimizing images can lead to slow loading times, which
        that affects the user experience. -->

        <!-- 12. **Not planning the page structure**: The lack of a well-planned structure
        can lead to maintenance issues as the website grows. -->

<!-- Remember that practice and constant review are essential to improve your HTML skills
and avoid common mistakes. Use validation tools and online resources to debug your code
Html. -->

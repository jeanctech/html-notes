<!-- Multimedia Tags in Html -->

<!-- Html provides several tags to embed multimedia content, such as images, audio, and
video, on your web pages. Here are some of the most common tags for multimedia content. -->

     <!-- 1. **Image (`<img>`)**: The `<img>` tag is used to display images on a web page.
     You must provide the image source using the `src` attribute. -->

     <img src="image.jpg" alt="Alternative text">

     - `src`: Specifies the URL of the image.
     - `alt`: Provides alternative text for the image, useful for accessibility and in case the image does not load.

      <!-- 2. **Audio (`<audio>`)**: The `<audio>` tag is used to insert audio content into
      a Web page. You can provide multiple formats for greater cross-browser compatibility. -->

     <audio controls>
         <source src="my-audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

     </audio>

     - `controls`: Adds playback controls (play, pause, etc.) to the audio player.
     - `<source>`: Allows you to specify different audio sources in formats supported by different browsers.

      <!-- 3. **Video (`<video>`)**: The `<video>` tag is used to embed video content in
      a Web page. As with audio, various video formats can be provided. -->

      <!-- 4. **Canvas (`<canvas>`)**: The `<canvas>` tag is used to draw graphics, animations
      and visual elements using JavaScript. -->

<!-- Aside in Html -->

<!-- The `<aside>` Html element is used to mark content that is related or secondary
with respect to the main content of a web page. You can use `<aside>` to include content
additional information that complements the main information on the page, such as sidebars, notes, advertising
, related links, widgets and more. Below I show you an example of how the element is used
`<aside>` in Html. -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Example of &lt;aside&gt;</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Main Title</h1>
        </header>
        <aside>
            <h2>Sidebar</h2>
            <p>This is secondary content, such as related links or widgets.</p>
        </aside>
        <main>
            <h2>Main content</h2>
            <p>This is the main content of the web page.</p>
        </main>
        <footer>
            <p>Footer</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

<!-- In this example, we have used `<aside>` to create a sidebar that contains content
secondary. This is just an example, and you can customize the content within `<aside>` based on the
needs of your website. -->

<!-- The `<aside>` element is especially useful for improving the semantic structure of the page and
facilitate the understanding of content by search engines and technologies
attendance. -->
